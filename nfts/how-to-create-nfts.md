### How to Create NFTs 

#### Choose the best platform for you 

With over 50 platforms you can choose from, it’s no wonder that you can get lost. Not all platforms are created equal, so it’s best if you check them out individually.

Some platforms are invite-only, like Nifty Gateway, Knoworigin, and SuperRare. While some require user verification \(Rarible, Foundation\).

Most platforms also charge a service fee, called a "gas fee" for the computational mining caused by transactions using Ethereum’s blockchain. For example, Nifty Gateway takes 5% plus $0.30 of every secondary sale. SuperRare takes 3% transaction from all purchases, paid by the buyer. Foundation charges up to a whopping 15% commission depending how quickly you want the transaction to be completed and how busy the network is at the time of your transaction. While OpenSea, on the other hand, offers a “lazy minting” option, which amounts to the deferred payment of gas fees until the actual sale.

Yet these gas fees can fluctuate even during the course of one day, so the best thing to do is check the platforms individually when deciding to mint.
