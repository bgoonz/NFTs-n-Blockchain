### How to Sell NFTs 

Ether is the most common cryptocurrency you can sell your NFTs for. So it's easier if you create your NFT on the Ethereum network since this is what most people are using.

The platforms mentioned above all operate the same, so you will most likely have to perform the below steps when setting up your NFT for sale.

First step: create an account. Then create a MetaMask Wallet where your digital currencies will live. MetaMask supports ERC-721 \(the Ethereum-based NFT token standard\). But you are free to create any other Ethereum wallet, depending on your preference.

After, you can set up single or multiple collectibles, and basically, you can upload anything you want. Depending on the platform, you will be shown the percentage of commissioned gas, or you will be directed to a gasless mint. To save yourself time, make sure you connect your Wallet in this step as well.

Fill out any details they prompt you to, add your file, add any preview images, throw in a description and a name and select whether you want the item’s copyright to transfer over once the sale is made. You can set up a fixed price, or an auction, or a combo of both.

And that’s it! Now you can start selling your new NFT.
